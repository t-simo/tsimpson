Welcome! 

I completed my PhD at The Centre for Human Psychopharmacology at Swinburne University. I have been investigating oxidative stress in older adults and its relationship with cognitive performance. Firstly, to see whether over the counter herbal supplements increase glutathione within the human brain, secondly to observe cognitive changes over time, and lastly to investigate the relationship between glutathione and cognitive ability. My study involved magnetic resonance spectrosocpy to measure the brain's neurochemical changes.
